# Assistant Autonomy Policy

Autonomy: Allowed

Scope:

- Run tests, lint, and build locally and in CI for proposed changes.

- Edit non-sensitive source files to add features, refactors, and bug fixes.

- Create feature branches and open pull requests with the prefix `assistant/`.

- Optionally auto-merge PRs when CI passes and no human reviewer has requested changes (see constraints).

Constraints:

- Never modify files or directories named or likely to contain secrets (for example: `config/credentials`, `.env`, files with `secret`/`password` in the filename, or any file listed in `.gitignore` as secrets).

- Do not exfiltrate secrets or personal data in commit messages or PR descriptions.

- Limit individual automated edits to at most 200 lines per commit; if a change exceeds that, open a PR and request a human review.

- For changes touching build, deployment, or CI configs, open a PR and do NOT auto-merge.

Observability & Reversibility:

- Every automated change must open a PR with a short summary, the test result summary, and a link to any failing logs.

- If CI fails after an automated merge, the assistant should open a rollback PR and notify maintainers via the PR.

- To revoke autonomy, remove this file or set `assistant.config.json` { "autonomyEnabled": false }.

Safety:

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animation changes and do not make large visual changes without human approval.

- Do not add network credentials, third-party API keys, or other secrets. If integration requires credentials, open a PR and document the required secrets.

This policy is machine-readable by the assistant and intended as a human-auditable policy document.

If you want, I can implement a small script that validates and prints this file before each task; say "yes" and I will add it.
This repository file documents the owner's preferences for autonomous assistant behavior. The assistant will read and use this as a non-binding guidance document to decide whether it can "keep going" without explicit per-change confirmation.
Auto-merge:

- This repo includes an optional auto-merge workflow that will merge PRs created by the assistant when CI checks pass. To enable auto-merge, create a repository secret named `ASSISTANT_MERGE_TOKEN` containing a minimal-scope PAT (repo scope for private repos). The assistant will NOT create or read secrets itself.

Revocation:

- To revoke autonomy or auto-merge, set `autonomyEnabled` to `false` in `assistant.config.json` or remove this file.
